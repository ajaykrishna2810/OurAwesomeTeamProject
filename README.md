## Problem statement ##

Given a data set that contains n number of independent variables (input features), predict the stability value (output feature). Based on the relation between the input features and the stability value, provide some insights/tips on selecting/controlling the input features such that the insatbility issue may be reduced.  

## Questions answered ##

-  What is stability?
-  What are the input features?
-  How can we evaluate the stability/instability based on the input features? 
-  Can we predict stability with less number of input variables?
